Graduated from Cornell with Distinction in all Subjects, Magna Cum Laude.

In addition, with solid support and genuine trust from faculty and staff members, I had the tremendous honor to be nominated and selected as one of the 40 [Cornell Arts and Sciences extraordinary seniors](https://as.cornell.edu/news/pandemic-served-reminder-focus-present) representing the class of 2023.
