I have no experience writing C in python with <code>ctypes</code>, so I figured why not ask the magic <del> conch shell </del> ChatGPT?</p> <p><span id="more"></span>&lt;p&gt;I’ve asked him several “how to write …” questions since its release, but this was the first time I actually ask him to help me understand a snippet of code so I can proceed to debugging. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It did pretty good in my first question, as it should do as the SOTA LLM model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/q0.png" alt="q0">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/a0.png" alt="a0">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What strikes me is the context-aware ability it showed in my second question. It is well known it can do so from all the demos, but seeing it actually work with a real example of your own is really a different story. <strong>Here, I just asked an absolutely arbitrary question and it knew what I was referring to</strong>&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/q1.png" alt="q1">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/a1.png" alt="a1">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It became mostly clear to me where the bug was, but to make sure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/q2.png" alt="q2">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/a2.png" alt="a2">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/q3.png" alt="q3">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/a3.png" alt="a3">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At last, I conveniently asked it how to fix this bug &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/q4.png" alt="q4">&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;<img src="/images/2023-04-04-First-Time-Debugging-with-ChatGPT/a4.png" alt="a4">&lt;/p&gt;</p> </body></html>
