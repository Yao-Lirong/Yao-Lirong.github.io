I am currently a computer science master student at the gorgeous [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu), the same school I graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor's Degree in CS. After graduation, I worked as a machine learning research engineer at the Internet Business department of [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com) based in [Nanjing, Jiangsu, China](https://www.bing.com/maps?&ty=18&q=Xiaomi%20East%20China%20Headquarters&ss=ypid.4067x17940781823802936259&mb=31.976237~118.686708~31.967009~118.723336&description=Nanjing%2C%20JIANGSU&cardbg=%23768DF1&dt=1756836000000&tt=Xiaomi%20East%20China%20Headquarters&tsts0=%2526ty%253D18%2526q%253DXiaomi%252520East%252520China%252520Headquarters%2526ss%253Dypid.4067x17940781823802936259%2526mb%253D31.976237~118.686708~31.967009~118.723336%2526description%253DNanjing%25252C%252520JIANGSU%2526cardbg%253D%252523768DF1%2526dt%253D1756836000000&tstt0=Xiaomi%20East%20China%20Headquarters&cp=31.971623~118.705022&lvl=16&pi=0&ftst=0&ftics=False&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027). 

I am broadly intersted in human and machine intelligence. When at Cornell, I had the great honor to work with professor [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/) on the [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC), a general fluid intelligence benchmark. I am thrilled by the recent Generative AI boom since the advent of ChatGPT and most of my current work at Xiaomi involved applying language, image, and multi-modal models. On top of these, I lead kick-starting the [Edge AI project]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/edge_ai.md %}), an annual key project in Internet Business department.

When I am not [wielding the magic wand and casting computing spells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SICP_cover.jpg), I like Japanese pop culture, especially [manga](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E7%94%BA%E3%81%AF%E5%BB%BB%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B-%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%96%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E5%BB%BB%E8%A6%A7%E6%9D%BF-%E3%83%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E7%9F%B3%E9%BB%92-%E6%AD%A3%E6%95%B0/dp/4785959606) and [anime](https://zombielandsaga.com/1st/index2.php). I taught myself Japanese to an N2 level during remote study in the COVID year. I also try to make music after having taken the [Digital Music](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/MUSIC/1421) and [Songwriting](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/MUSIC/2111) class at Cornell. I worked as both a programmer and the sole sound designer of game [Aphelion Defense]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/aphelion_defense.md %}), my final programming project at Cornell.
