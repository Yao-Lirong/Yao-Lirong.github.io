## Sept 2023

I am a machine learning research engineer at the Internet Business department of [Xiaomi](https://www.mi.com) based in [Nanjing, Jiangsu, China](https://www.bing.com/maps?osid=44d1bde7-594f-4881-8353-504c54e7fd25&cp=31.971623~118.705022&lvl=16&pi=0&v=2&sV=2&form=S00027). Prior to industry, I received my Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science from the gorgeous [Cornell University](https://www.cs.cornell.edu).

I am broadly intersted in human and machine intelligence. When at Cornell, I had the great honor to work with professor [Kevin Ellis](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~ellisk/) on the [Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus](https://github.com/fchollet/ARC), a general artificial intelligence benchmark. I am thrilled by the recent Generative AI boom since the advent of ChatGPT and most of my current work at Xiaomi involves language and image generative models.

When I am not [wielding the magic wand and casting computing spells](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:SICP_cover.jpg), I like Japanese pop culture, especially [manga](https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E3%81%9D%E3%82%8C%E3%81%A7%E3%82%82%E7%94%BA%E3%81%AF%E5%BB%BB%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%84%E3%82%8B-%E5%85%AC%E5%BC%8F%E3%82%AC%E3%82%A4%E3%83%89%E3%83%96%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E5%BB%BB%E8%A6%A7%E6%9D%BF-%E3%83%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%AD%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0%E3%82%B3%E3%83%9F%E3%83%83%E3%82%AF%E3%82%B9-%E7%9F%B3%E9%BB%92-%E6%AD%A3%E6%95%B0/dp/4785959606) and [anime](https://zombielandsaga.com/1st/index2.php). I taught myself Japanese to an N3~N2 level during remote study in the COVID year. I also try to make music after having taken the [Digital Music](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/MUSIC/1421) and [Songwriting](https://classes.cornell.edu/browse/roster/FA22/class/MUSIC/2111) class at Cornell. I worked as the sound designer of game [Aphelion Defense]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/aphelion_defense.md %}), my final programming project at Cornell, and am currently working on a music generative AI model aside from work.
